Matthew T. Mason is the Chief Scientist at Berkshire Grey, and Professor Emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

Matt has spent 50 years conducting research in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, starting as a student in the MIT AI Lab where he earned the BS, MS, and PhD degrees. He spent much of his career at CMU’s Robotics Institute, where he was the founder and co-director of the Manipulation Laboratory, and for ten years served as the Director of the Robotics Institute. Matt’s group studied the basic physics governing grasping and manipulation, and demonstrated that sophisticated grasping and manipulation can be produced by the simple and robust grippers used in industrial automation.

Mason is a Fellow of the AAAI, AAAS, ACM, and IEEE, and a winner of the IEEE R&A Society’s Pioneer Award, and the IEEE Technical Field Award in Robotics and Automation (the R&A Prize).

Matt now focuses his attention on logistics and warehouse robotics, helping to produce industry-leading solutions at Berkshire Grey.
